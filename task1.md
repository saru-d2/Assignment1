## LinearRegression().fit()
Given test data, LinearRegression().fit() uses certain ML algorithms to find the weights and bias of a regression that yield the most accurate results. In the case of a simple regression, this happens to be the 'line of best fit'.

(insert the equation for a multivariable regression and specify the weights and bias)

To calculate the aforementioned 'accuracy' of a set of weights and bias, the MSE (Mean Squared Error) is used. LinearRegression().fit() aims to reduce this MSE as much as possible to result in the most accurate set of weights and bias that it can acheive.

(insert the formula for MSE)
